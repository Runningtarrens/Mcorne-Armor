Pause for inserting Magnets

Bottom: 1.8mm (layer 9) for tenting magnets, 9.8mm (layer 49) for Case Magnets

Top:    4.8mm (layer 24)


Those are the values i use and i use PrusaSlicer. Im not Sure if cura or a different slicer uses the Pause differently. But Pause at layer 9 means, the pause is after layer 8 finishes and before layer 9 starts.
